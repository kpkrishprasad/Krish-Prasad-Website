        "Youtube Copilot is a web app that provides YouTube video summaries, generates timestamps, and includes an interactive chatbot for querying video content. Built with Django as the backend framework, it uses the YouTube Data API to extract video captions, which are processed with advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques such as text summarization and keyword extraction. The Django backend orchestrates the data flow and serves the processed content, while the front-end, powered by JavaScript, handles dynamic content updates and user interactions. The applicationâ€™s interface is styled with responsive CSS, ensuring a smooth and intuitive user experience, making it easier to explore and understand video content."

        "This project focuses on predicting the duration of major U.S. power outages from 2000 to 2016, " +
        "using a Random Forest Regressor implemented in Python. Leveraging scikit-learn for machine learning and pandas " +
        "for data manipulation, the project addresses complex challenges in the energy domain, such as the impact of " +
        "climate anomalies, urbanization, and economic factors on power grid resilience. Advanced data preprocessing, " +
        "including imputation via K-Nearest Neighbors and feature transformations like quantile normalization, were " +
        "employed to enhance the model's accuracy. The model, fine-tuned through grid search, achieved a notable " +
        "improvement in R-squared, indicating its efficacy in capturing the multifaceted interactions affecting outage " +
        "durations. A fairness analysis ensured that predictions remain unbiased across different population groups, " +
        "reinforcing the model's reliability in this critical infrastructure domain."
